- I created new project and install tailwind css everything.

- I have idea about creating Card components.

- i just create card components and import it ti app.vue page. But it's not render, igot error.

- i stuck there 2 hours.

- i delete that project try to do again.

- it sucessfully render. my mistake is when i try to import that components the components name is added in mustache syntax in App.vue  
  page automatically.

- after that i created array that contain details of card in app.vue page.

- used for loop to create card.

- and i try to use v-if but i didn't get sucessfull result.
